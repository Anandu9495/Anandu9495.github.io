										<h1>PROTOTYPING WITH 3D PRINTING</h1>

									<p>We used  Blender 3D printing to prototype the spider robot with servo motors. It has a number of advantages. One of the primary benefits is the opportunity to test and refine our design quickly, which lets to enhance the functionality and performance of the robot. Complex geometries and unique items that would be difficult or impossible to fabricate using conventional manufacturing methods can be created with 3D printing.</p>
									<p>Some of the main reasons why we used blender for protoyping is shown below:</p>

                                                                       <h2>1. RAPID PROTOTYPING:</h2>
<p>Rapid prototyping was our first priority because it saves time and money compared to traditional prototype techniques by enabling us to quickly construct and test our concept using 3D printing.So what is rapid prototyping? it is the process of making complex and difficult design for a solid  prototye such as 3d printing laser cutting (Zhang, L. and Lu, H. (2024).Its duty is in a short period of time to checks if the protoyping will work with its full capability.The main reason of using rapid prototyping are .</p>
									<p>It helps to quickly test our product gives us more time testing so it drastically reduce the making time of the project.</p>
									<p>In rapid prototyping due to the fast development it gives us time to fix any problems in the design so its cost friendly.</p>
									<p>EXAMPLE:3D printed spider limbs with the help of rapid prototyping.</p>

                                                                       <h2>2. CUSTOMIZATION:</h2>
<p>Customization is actually a vital part of the process because it gives us the freedom of changing the design and feature of the robot by our need which can effect the robots behavior and capability.</p>
									<p>For Example has u can  see the T8 robot which uses 26 servo motors which is run by  bigfoot engine Bojana RomiÄ‡ (2018).T8 robot is the prime example result of a customized robot. 
We would have more options if we added an Arduino uno or mega to get a large verity of customization for the bot which we will do in the near future.  we made special components to meet certain design specifications, like difficult geometries for servo motor mount customisation..</p>

									<h2>3. INTEGRATION WITH SERVO MOTORS:</h2>
									<p>Servo motors are very common in these days it is  designed in such a way that we can control its position, rotation , speed .It is a self contained electrical device which plays a vital roll in  the project to move the joints .We produced a more advanced and useful robot by creating unique servo motor mounts and integrating them with the spider robot's legs.There are different types of servo motors:-.</p>
									<p>DC SERVO MOTORS: We have used Dc servo motors for our project because of its compatibility and rotation , these motors are run from a dc supply. It is commonly used in robotics.</p>
									<p>STEPPER SERVO MOTORS: Has the name describes it the motor use a stepper motor for more high accuracy and precision, we did not use this motor because  the amount of speed it delivers is more that we want and the major drawback for this motor is it can not maintain  a fixed speed in high torque</p>
									<p>BRUSHLESS SERVO MOTORS: These motors doesn't have brush like other motors and these motors are used in high end applications where top speed is needed. </p>
									<p>Integration with a servo motors play a major roll because it defines the robots speed, direction and rotation .In our  with the help of integration we where able to move our robot to perform different tasks with precise control and movement.</p>

									<h2>4. FLEXIBILITY:</h2>
									<p>Blender gave us the ability to make parts with specific geometries, such hollow or curved structures, that would be challenging or impossible to make using conventional manufacturing techniques..</p>
