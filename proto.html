										<h1>TECHNOLOGIES NOT USED AND WHY?</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="#"><img src="#" alt="" /></span>

									<p>The 3 technologies that have not  been used  and the reson behind it is shown below:</p>
										<hr class="major" />
                                                                       <h2>1. MOTION CAPTURE:</h2>
<p>Motion capture(MOCAP) is used mostly in replicating the human or animal movements but in our case spider have a very complex leg movement which makes it difficult to track it with accuracy even the small size of the spider is major factor for not able to do it .Motion capture technology is actually complex to set up .
It is  expensive, especially high-end systems that provide accurate and detailed data.
 Motion capture was not necessary for making the spider robot to move is because we used physics-based simulations and with the help of the servo motors it can move.
 Motion capture requires a dedicated space to set up the cameras and sensors, where has in servo motors it moves by via code.It also need a large data to produce accurate movement and taking it from a spider is very complex.</p>
									<p>EXAMPLE: Motion capture is mostly used in movies for CGI effect has you can see in movies like The planet of the kingdom of the apes where a detailed motion capture was taken to study the movements of the apes and by collecting the data they where able to cgi  .</p>

                                                                       <h2>2. LASER CUTTING:</h2>
<p>Laser cutting is done using a high powered laser beam which can cut most of the objects like, wood, steel, plastic  by melting it and shaping it in our need.
Down below are some limitations that we considered for not using laser cutting: ..</p>
									<p>Material limitation: In our project the spider limbs are all made in a geometrically curved shape and attached a mount for the servo motors. Laser cutting is best for thin material but it is made when it comes to cutting a curved shaped object..</p>
									<p>Material Properties: Our robot 3d parts is made from resin so it is actually a bad combination with laser cutting because it can melt or burn there are some substance like Fiber glass and epoxy that should be  avoid putting it under laser cutting because it will produce  lethal toxic gas.</p>
									<p>Cost and Complexity: It is really costly and consumes a lot of time .</p>
									<p>EXAMPLE: Laser cutting is mostly used in Jewelery making to give a large varity of design and leather crafting.</p>
